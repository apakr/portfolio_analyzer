Godddd I hate writing readme files.....

This is a script that you can use to figure out important porfolio management statistics about a portfolio:
1. Expected Return
2. Standard Deviation
3. Beta
4. Sharpe Ratio
5. Alpha

You need a CSV with the stocks/funds you own and the number of each security that you own - look at fin456_portfolio_holdings_t0 for an example. 
The program uses yfinance to get the data.
